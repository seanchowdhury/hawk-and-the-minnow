### Architecture and Technologies

The game is built with the  following technologies:

- `JavaScript` for building the game's movement and platform logic,
- `Canvas` for rendering of the actual game map,
- `HTML DOM/CSS5` for styling tweaks

The game uses object oriented principles to do the heavy lifting and is broken into a few major scripts:

- `game.js` to handle the user's traversal of the map
- `player.js` to handle the player's state and movement
- `platform.js`, `exit.js` and `levels.js` to organize the game's other features.
