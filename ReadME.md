## Hawk and the Minnow

### Background

Hawk and the Minnow is a puzzle platformer built with JavaScript and Canvas.


### Functionality & MVP  

Users will be able to:

- [ ] Play the game
- [ ] Have a good time
- [ ] Nothing groundbreaking just an bug-free and enjoyable experience.

In addition, this project will include:

- [ ] All open-source/royalty free assets and attention to detail.
- [ ] This production README

### Architecture and Technologies

This project will be implemented with the following technologies:

- `JavaScript` for building the game's movement and platform logic,
- `Canvas` for rendering of the actual game map,
- `HTML DOM/CSS` for styling tweaks.

The game will be broken into a few major scripts:

- `game.js` to handle the user's traversal of the map
- `player.js` to handle the player's state and movement
- `platform.js` and `exit.js` to track the map's key features


### Implementation Timeline

**Day 1**: Figure out how to draw an object in canvas and display that on index.html

- Learn how to use Canvas.
- Use Canvas.

**Day 2**: Allow user input on the drawn object and begin working on the player physics and begin catching them with platforms:

- Be able to move a block across the Canvas area.
- Have the block fall off the map with 'gravity' if user is not countering it.
- Draw platforms and begin collision logic.

**Day 3**: Complete platform collision logic and work on phasing.

- Be able to perfectly collide with platforms and phase through if button is pressed.
- Begin designing levels.

**Day 4**: Design levels and add exits, begin styling.

- Design a level and add exits to next level.
- Collect art assets and begin styling game.


### Bonus features

Some anticipated updates are:

- [ ] More levels
- [ ] Help/color text
